# George Backend Chapter - Coding Challenge
Congratulations. You made it to our next recruiting stage which is a coding challenge. In this stage you have to show practical skills in the things which you discussed in the previous recruiting stage:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Refactoring
- Automated Testing (Developer Tests)

This stage is split into two parts
1. Home Assignment (expected effort: 3 hours)
2. Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions (4 hours)

__Please note__: The home assignment is the precondition for the Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions. Only if we are happy with part 1 you will be invited to part 2 of our coding challenge stage. 

### Home Assignment 
We expect you to work 3 hours on the example application which we soon will explain to you in more detail. Of course, we can't prevent you from putting more hours in which we for sure don't expect. Please, as soon as you have finished the home assignment (3 hours of work) let us know, so that we can start with the evaluation.

### Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions
Considering your home assignment was successful, you will be invited to the 2nd part of this stage. There you will collaborate in four sessions with George Backend Chapter team members in a remote fashion by using Skype. You will receive more details about the Remote-Pair-Programming sessions via email.

### Exercise: Word Count Kata
Please find the requirements for the Word Count Kata on the following [website](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/#cd8). At the bottom of that page you will find all requirements split into 9 iterations. The goal of this exercise is __not__ to finish as many iterations as possible. We will evaluate your solution based on quality over quantity. 

Please focus on code quality by applying
- Object-Oriented Design, 
- Refactoring and 
- Developer-Tests (aka Unit- and Integration-Tests).

Please always look only at one iteration at a time. The goal is to come up with a design which makes future changes to your code base as easy as possible. Of course, you shouldn't over engineer your solution but only design as much as needed. This is exactly what we are going to evaluate.

### Feature Branches
In the George Backend Chapter you have to work in feature branches for each task. As soon as you finish your task you will open up a pull request on GitHub which then will be reviewed at least by two of your colleagues. Therefore, think of solving an iteration as if you would solve a task for our team. Always focus on quality and come up with a codebase which you would be happy working in. Empathy in our team is highly valued. We always put ourselves into our reviewers position to improve their life reviewing our code.

For each iteration, please create a branch with the following pattern: `firstname_lastname_iteration_nr_homeassignment`. Your first iteration must branch off `master`, or in case you want to use Kotlin, please branch of `kotlin_maven_baseline`. Your branches won't be merged back to master. Every new branch must branch of the previous branch.

For the Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions please replace ``homeassignment`` with the first name of the team member who is going to work with you.

### Assumptions 
In case the requirements are ambiguous, please write down your assumptions into the project's `assumptions.txt` file. Please always create a section for each iteration and put your assumptions under this section. The reason for this is, so that we can follow certain design decisions in your code which you came up with based on your assumptions.

### Evaluation
We will only evaluate your finished iterations. Even though we don't expect you to work more than 3 hours for the home assignment, it would be nice if you could at least finish the first iteration. In case you only would be able to finish the first iteration by putting way more effort than 3 hours in, we will find a different solution on how to evaluate the code's state after 3 hours of work.

This example might also seem a bit hypothetical, but we believe it small but complicated enough, that it makes sense to come up with an Object-Oriented Design which is more than implementing your whole solution in a single main method ðŸ˜‰. The evaluation won't take longer than 1 work day. If we are happy with your solution we will send you the information for the Remote-Pair-Programming Sessions. In case we won't continue the recruiting process with you, we will send you a detailed feedback of our evaluation.

### Requirements
Please use Java 8 or Kotlin as a programming language. No Framework is allowed for this exercise. No other library than JUnit must be used. Currently JUnit 5 is configured in the `pom.xml`. In case you prefer JUnit 4 over 5 please change the `pom.xml` file accordingly. We donâ€™t allow any mocking library. In case you see the need for mocking, please hand roll your mocks.

### Questions
In case this description triggers some questions on your side, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us. Other than that, we recommend starting with this exercise as soon as possible after you have received it. We wish you good luck and are very much looking forward to your solution.
